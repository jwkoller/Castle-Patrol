You set out from the Castle to begin tracking down these ruffians who prey upon the innocent....
You continue on to the next patrol point, bloodied but alive from your first encounter.
Another has fallen before you, yet more remain. On to the next way point.
The reward better be worth this. The dry cleaning bill alone...
There seems to be no end to their numbers, yet you must press on.

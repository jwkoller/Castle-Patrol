My name is Grand Archduke Knobblyknees. I am the lord of the surrounding lands in this great nation of Tridentopia.
Our great and wise and all knowing King Koller, first of his name, Master of the Java's, Slayer of the Coding Standards, has charged me with ridding the countryside of the monsters and ruffians who are part of a group known only as 167 Students.
To that end, I have requested your services to eliminate these hoodlums and restore sanity to the area.
There are several patrol points in the country side I want you to investigate and clear out of any riff raff.
You will be rewarded of course, and may keep any valuables you may find among the bandits.
Now go. I have some peasants to oppress.
Ah, you're back. And in one piece no less. Wonders never cease.
I trust there is nothing left of the menace in the area? I hope that is the case, for your sake. Our great and mighty King Koller is not as forgiving as I am.
Well stop gawking then, take your reward and go. The forest was not kind to your aroma and it's making me quesy.
